# nobrainer examples

_Nobrainer_ can be used to train models for classification tasks. Common classification tasks include brain extraction and brain labelling. Brain extraction is a binary problem, where the goal is to classify each voxel as brain or not brain. Brain labelling is a multi-class problem, where the goal is to classify each voxel as belonging to one of those classes (akin to FreeSurfer's `recon-all`).

Below are links to examples of training and saving models for brain extraction and brain labelling using the _Nobrainer_ command-line interface and Python interface. Examples of predicting on new data are also provided.
